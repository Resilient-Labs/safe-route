# SafeRoute📍 🗺️

**About:** SafeRoute is a community-powered safety map designed for neighborhoods to come together and empower one another with knowledge and resources. It lets residents anonymously report sightings of broken streetlights, suspicious activity, dangerous infrastructure, and more.

With a clean map view and accessible submission form, SafeRoute enables everyone— especially marginalized communities such as disabled folks, women, and elders— to move through their communities with confidence. SafeRoute is built for local awareness, fear reduction, and community solidarity through real-time, peer-sourced alerts.

## ⚙️ Optimizations:
You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!
