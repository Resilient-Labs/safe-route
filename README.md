<h1 align="center"> 📍SafeRoute 🗺️ </h1>

**About:** SafeRoute is a community-powered safety map designed for neighborhoods to come together and empower one another with knowledge and resources. It lets residents anonymously report sightings of broken streetlights, suspicious activity, dangerous infrastructure, and more.

With a clean map view and accessible submission form, SafeRoute enables everyone— especially marginalized communities such as disabled folks, women, and elders— to move through their communities with confidence. SafeRoute is built for local awareness, fear reduction, and community solidarity through real-time, peer-sourced alerts.

## 🏔️ Challenges:
- **Performance Optimization:** Through frequent correspondence, ticket delegation on a Kanban board, and RailWay deployment testing we facilitated an efficient, communicative workflow. Folks were able to balance their own assignments, along with supporting other team member's with theirs to ensure our application could be deployed in a timely manner.
- **Merge Conflict Resolution:** Engineers maneuvered through a guideline with examples of git commands to utilize when merge conflicts occur. Everyone worked with at least one other co-worker to ensure possible solutions could be discussed and challenges were addressed as a team.
- **Communication & Guidelines:** We developed a comprehensive reference document with clear expectations and avenues to explore when asking for assistance, troubleshooting, implementing new features, etc. Setting a foundation for us to communicate and collaborate cultivated our sense of togetherness and bolstered our ability to stay on track for our project.
